# fnncr

A personal finances and budgeting application.

## Setting up development environment and IDE

`fnncr`'s development environment was build using `Visual Studio Code`'s `devcontainer` feature to create a portable and standardized development environment. So you are required to install the following programs:

- Docker
- Visual Studio Code

Reopen the project in Container.

Open de Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows and `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and write `> Go: Install/Update Tools` and install all tools.

Now you can start all services.

## How to run development services and tooling

To start the application, run:

```shell
air
```

> For Hot-reloading the project uses cosmtrek's air tool. This tool is installed in the devcontainer's Dockerfile and is configured in the .air.toml file, so it's already configured.

To compile `templ` templates, run:

```shell
templ generate -watch
```

> For templating the project uses a-h's templ. The templates need to be compiled into Go code that's why you need to run this command. The project's .gitignore is already setup to ignore the files generated by templ. And the way air is setup it will hot-reload the application once templ generates the go files. This tool is installed in the devcontainer's Dockerfile and all Visual Studio Code tooling is configure already in the devcontainer.json file.
